### Challenge Analysis

I've written a small brief of each challenge in order to help to decide which one to tackle. I've also tried to group them into categories.

**Technology**

Where There's a Link - Present real-time information on factors affecting the spread of COVID-19.

Purify the Air Supply - COVID-19 has increased time spent indoors. Develop an air monitor/purifier.

**Data Analysis**

Quiet Planet - Document environmental changes caused by COVID-19 and how societies have responded.

Light the Path - Explore how human activity and movement patterns have been affected by COVID-19.

A New Perspective - Examine the impact of reduced human traffic from COVID-19 on natural spaces.

SDGs and COVID-19 - Monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the progress of Sustainable Development Goals.

Human Factors - Identify patterns between populations and cases, and factors that can predict hotspots.

An Integrated Assessment - Integrate Earth data with socio-economic data to discover COVID-19 impacts.

**Engineering**

Food for Thought - Propose solutions to local/global food supply issues caused by COVID-19.

The Isolation Solution - Develop solutions to combat social isolation.

**Art**

The Art of It All - Express the experience of living through COVID-19 with a work of art.

**Space**

A platform of communities to bring people together with friends before gaming/online activities.

- Offer insights for astronauts suffering from isolation on spaceflight.

Big data science to see how the mood of players has improved.

- Contain or reference space agency data.

Reference HI-SEAS to see isolation problems and how astronauts deal with them.

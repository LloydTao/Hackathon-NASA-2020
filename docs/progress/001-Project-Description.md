# Bunch Up

## The Lockdown Problem

In this new age of social lockdown, many have turned to video games and other online activities to stay entertained and connected. 

However, those without existing social groups to mingle with may find themselves playing alone. 

The online matchmaking of games and services fails to introduce people, and so, these interactions manage to still feel lonely.

## A Solution to Social Isolation

We're developing a platform of communities to bring people together.

By allowing users to join 'activity hubs' and mingle with the people they play with, the online activity experience is greatly improved.

## Benefiting Astronauts

Our platform uses data analysis to discover the activities that specific demographics participate in. With this data, we can recommend more relevant or accessible hubs and activities  to people.

Astronauts suffering from isolation on spaceflight can go to the front page and have customised recommendations that better suit their circumstances. 

For example, we can push a hub with users in similar work circumstances, or online activities that aren't affected by high latency.

## Space Agency Data

We're referencing HI-SEAS in order to identify isolation problems and target them.

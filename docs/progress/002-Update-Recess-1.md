## Recess 1 (May 30th - 14:00)

We're now taking our first break after 3 hours of development.

**Jordan** has created most of the web prototypes with Adobe XD.

**Lewis** has set up the Django project and apps, worked on the back-end features such as routing, static files, templates and installing apps.

**Matt** has worked on the database schema and implemented some models with Django.
